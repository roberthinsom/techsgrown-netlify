        <h2>The Cloud Computing Landscape</h2>
        <h3>A Brief Overview of Cloud Computing</h3>
        <p>Cloud computing has revolutionized how businesses manage and deploy applications and services. By offering scalable resources over the internet, it has enabled organizations to reduce infrastructure costs, improve accessibility, and facilitate remote work. Major providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have dominated the market, allowing companies to leverage vast amounts of computing power without the need for physical hardware.</p>

        <h3>Limitations of Cloud Computing</h3>
        <p>Despite its advantages, cloud computing has limitations, particularly regarding latency, bandwidth, and dependency on stable internet connections. As applications become more data-intensive—think IoT devices, real-time analytics, and augmented reality—the need for speedier processing and lower latency becomes critical. This is where edge computing steps in.</p>

        <h2>Enter Edge Computing</h2>
        <h3>What is Edge Computing?</h3>
        <p>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed. Instead of relying solely on centralized cloud servers, edge computing enables data to be processed at or near the source of data generation. This minimizes the distance data must travel, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of Edge Computing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduced Latency:</strong> By processing data closer to the source, edge computing significantly decreases response times, which is crucial for applications that require real-time processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Bandwidth Efficiency:</strong> Edge computing minimizes the amount of data sent to the cloud, optimizing bandwidth and lowering costs associated with data transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Security and Privacy:</strong> Localized data processing can enhance security and privacy by reducing the amount of sensitive data transmitted over the network.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Edge computing systems can continue to function independently of cloud services, making them more resilient to outages.</li>
        </ul>
